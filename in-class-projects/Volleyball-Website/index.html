        <p>Only 6 players on the court at any given time: 3 in the front<br>  row and 3 in the back row.
            Points are made on every serve for<br>  the winning team of the rally (rally-point scoring).
            Players may<br>  not hit the ball twice in succession (a block is not considered a<br>  hit).
            Ball may be played off the net during a volley and on a serve.<br> 
            A ball hitting a boundary line is in.
            A ball is out if it hits an<br>  antennae, the floor completely outside the court, any of the net <br> or cables outside the antennae, the referee stand or pole, or the <br> ceiling above a non-playable area.
            It is legal to contact the ball<br>  with any part of a player’s body.
            It is illegal to catch, hold or throw <br> the ball.
            A player cannot block or attack a serve from on or inside <br> the 10-foot line.
            After the serve, front-line players may switch <br> positions at the net.
            Matches are made up of sets; the number<br>  depends on level of play.</p>

        <p>Passing is often thought of as the most important skill<br> in volleyball. If you can't pass the serve, then you won't<br> ever put your team in a position to score a point.
            The<br> importance of serving is often undervalued. Many<br> coaches don't teach players to serve aggressive and<br> use this opportunity to give the team an advantage for<br> scoring points.
            Blocking is perhaps the least taught skill<br> in volleyball. Players can get away with poor blocking<br> skills because not blocking isn't going to hurt the team<br> as much as  being poor at executing other skills in volleyball.</p>

        <p>Setter, Outside Hitter, Opposite Hitter, Middle Blocker,<br> Libero, Defensive Specialist. Also known as the right-side<br> hitter, these players need to be a perfect balance of both<br> offense and defense. They will also get many opportunities<br> to hit the volleyball, so similar to the outside hitter, jumping<br> ability is vital. The main difference that sets the opposite<br> hitter apart is their defensive responsibility. Being able to<br> receive the serve from the opposing team is just one of the<br> many requirements of this specialized positionThe middle<br> blocker, sometimes known as the middle hitter, is the tallest<br> player on the volleyball team. Their main role for the team is<br> being the first line of defense against the opposing team’s hits.<br> The middle blocker needs to read the other team’s attackers to<br> quickly raise his or her arms above the net in a blocking<br> attempt. However, this is not a defense-only position. The middle<br> blocker will have chances for quick points throughout the set.</p>

        <p>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan<br>, physical director of the <a href="https://www.ymcansw.org.au/" target="_blank">Young Men’s Christian Association</a><br> (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. It was designed as an<br> indoor sport for businessmen who found the new game of<br> basketball too vigorous. Morgan called the sport<br> “mintonette,” until a professor from Springfield College<br> in Massachusetts noted the volleying nature of play and<br> proposed the name of “volleyball.” The original rules were<br> written by Morgan and printed in the first edition of the Official<br> Handbook of the Athletic League of the Young Men’s Christian<br> Associations of North America (1897). The game soon proved to<br> have wide appeal for both sexes in schools, playgrounds, the<br> armed forces, and other organizations in the United States, and<br> it was subsequently introduced to other countries. In 1916 rules<br> were issued jointly by the YMCA and the National Collegiate<br> Athletic Association (NCAA).</p>
