## 🧩 Overview

This project showcases a multi-functional learning system built entirely in Python. It integrates core programming constructs such as conditional logic, loops, functions, and input validation to deliver a user-friendly console experience. The application is structured around four key modules:

---

## 🧮 Features

- 📐 **Pythagoras Calculator**  
  Calculates the hypotenuse or missing side of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. Includes input validation to prevent invalid geometric configurations.

- 📏 **Area Calculator**  
  Computes the area of four geometric shapes: square, rectangle, triangle, and circle. Each calculation is encapsulated in its own function, with error handling for negative or zero inputs.

- 🔎 **Triangle Identifier**  
  Accepts three side lengths and determines the triangle type (equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid). Includes logic to detect right-angled triangles using the converse of Pythagoras.

- ❔ **Area Quiz System**  
  Randomly generates shape dimensions and prompts the user to calculate the area. Tracks score and accuracy, providing feedback and a final performance summary. Implements randomization, scoring logic, and float precision handling.

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Each feature is encapsulated in its own loop or function, promoting readability and maintainability.  
- **Input Validation**: Robust error handling ensures only valid numerical inputs are accepted, with clear user feedback.  
- **Mathematical Logic**: Implements geometric formulas and theorem checks with precision rounding for user-facing outputs.  
- **Randomization**: Uses Python’s `random` module to generate dynamic quiz content and shape selection.  
- **User Experience**: Includes terminal-clearing functions and spacing controls to simulate a clean UI flow within the console.
