## 📚 Overview

This folder contains two major assessment tasks completed during Year 11 Software Design and Development. Each project demonstrates a different programming paradigm and set of technical skills, with a focus on user experience, modularity, and real-world application. These projects form part of my portfolio for early entry into the Bachelor of Cybersecurity at UTS.

## 🧮 Assessment Task 1 – Learning Application

A console-based educational tool designed to reinforce mathematical concepts through interactive modules and quizzes.

### 🔧 Features
- 📐 **Pythagoras Calculator** – Calculates hypotenuse and side lengths with input validation  
- 🧮 **Area Calculator** – Computes area for square, rectangle, triangle, and circle  
- 🔎 **Triangle Identifier** – Classifies triangle types based on side lengths and Pythagorean checks  
- ❔ **Area Quiz System** – Randomized shape-based quizzes with scoring and feedback

### 🧠 Technical Highlights
- Modular function-based design  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Use of `math` and `random` libraries  
- Console UX enhancements (clearing, spacing, formatting)
